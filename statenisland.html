<p>The Staten Island boat graveyard is a marine scrapyard located in the Arthur Kill in 
Rossville, near the Fresh Kills Landfill on the northern shore of Staten Island, 
New York. The place has been recognized as an official dumping ground for old wrecked tugboats,
barges and decommissioned ferries. It is known by many other names including the 
Witte Marine Scrap Yard, the Arthur Kill Boat Yard, and the "Tugboat Graveyard." 
Its official name as of 2014 is the Donjon Iron and Metal Scrap Processing Facility.
The site is hard to reach and posted with "No trespassing" signs.[5] Nevertheless, visitors do come.
Marine historians explore the area via boats or kayaks. The decaying ships are a popular subject for photographers and artists 
because of its eerie environment, has become a tourist attraction,[1] despite its remote location and difficult accessibility 
via "a makeshift path of street signs and wood planks into muddy marshland and to the edge of the water where the boats are visible.</p>

Located along Staten Island's North Shore Waterfront Esplanade, the Staten Island September 11 Memorial 
resembles a pair of wings reaching skyward. Architect Masayuki Sono created the slim, smooth structures to
appear like oversize postcards, honoring the Staten Island victims of the 2001 terrorist attacks. 
The inside walls of the $2.77 million construction feature 274 plaques with the names, birthdays, job titles 
and profile silhouettes of loved ones lost.</p>

Free concerts and fireworks are just two of the many reasons why South Beach is one of Staten Island's 
most popular locales. There's more to do than sunbathing and swimming-though both are
favorites of many South Beach visitors. A fountain with six bronze dolphins features colorful lights 
that illuminate at night. There's a park especially for seniors that features checkerboard tables, 
bocce courts and lots of benches. And the Ocean Breeze fishing pier is huge—one of the largest in the City—and ideal
for fishing or just enjoying the atmosphere.
