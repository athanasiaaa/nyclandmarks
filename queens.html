With adventurous art, international cuisine, gorgeous parks and world-class sporting events, 
Queens features attractions to satisfy nearly every taste. Sports lovers can watch the 
New York Mets play baseball at Citi Field and, in a venue nearly adjacent, see the US 
Open host the world's best tennis players. But in Queens, every day can be an event, 
whether you're sampling the delectable Greek cuisine of Astoria or authentic Chinese 
food in Flushing. View inventive art at MoMA PS1 and Socrates Sculpture Park in Long 
Island City, and take in the stunning flora at the Queens Botanical Garden.</p>  
    
<p>Citi Field is a stadium located in Flushing Meadows Corona Park in the New York City borough of Queens. 
Completed in 2009, it is the home baseball park of Major League Baseball's New York Mets. Citi Field 
was built as a replacement for the formerly adjacent Shea Stadium, which opened in 1964 next to the 
site of the 1964-1965 World's Fair.

Citi Field was designed by Populous (then HOK Sport), and is named after Citigroup, a New York financial 
services company which purchased the naming rights. The $850 million baseball park was funded with $615 
million in public subsidies,including the sale of New York City municipal bonds which are to be repaid 
by the Mets plus interest. The payments will offset property taxes for the lifetime of the park. 
The Mets are receiving $20 million annually from Citibank in exchange for naming the stadium Citi Field. 
The entire public cost is being borne by city and state taxpayers in New York.

<p>Socrates Sculpture Park is a community engaged New York City waterfront park dedicated to supporting artists 
in the production and presentation of public art. Socrates Sculpture Park was an abandoned riverside landfill 
and illegal dumpsite until 1986 when a coalition of artists and community members, under the leadership of 
artist Mark di Suvero, transformed it into an open studio and exhibition space for artists and a neighborhood 
park for local residents. Today it is an internationally renowned outdoor museum and artist residency program 
that also serves as a vital New York City park offering a wide variety of free public services.</p>
