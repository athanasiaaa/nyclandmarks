The city of New York is home to many famous iconic landmarks. Some of these historic landmarks include: Times 
Square, the Empire State building, The Statue of Liberty, and The Freedom Tower. These grand tourist attractions 
have captured the spirit of the city over the years. The state of New York has definitely earned it's nickname
'the big apple' due to its fast-paced development in fashion, the arts, culture, global influence, and
finance. Breathtaking views from Top of the Rock, the Empire State Building and One World Observatory. 
Exhibits from throughout history at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Brooklyn Museum and 
New York Hall of Science. Thrilling performances at Lincoln Center, BAM and Barclays Center. 
Attractions in NYC suit all tastes. It is this charismatic atmosphere that personifies the city of New York 
and lures the rest of the world like a magnet to the big apple. Today, more than 36,000 buildings throughout 
New York City are protected as individual landmarks, interior landmarks, scenic landmarks, or as part of 141 
historic districts. According to the Landmarks Law, one of the purposes of safeguarding the buildings and 
places that represent New York City's history is to promote the use of designated landmarks for the education, 
pleasure and welfare of the people of the City. On this site, you will find some of these landmarks that truly 
capture the spirit of the big apple.

There is simply no place in the United States as brimming with opportunities as New York City. Those of us who 
live here open our doors to incredible options each and every day: The chance to experience the best and newest 
in the worlds of art, theater, dance, and music; the ability to feast on expertly prepared foods from all over the 
world; the belief that we can make our voices heard on political issues, in this news media capital of the nation; 
and the opportunity to meet today's movers and shakers. The ambitious come here because they know that if they want 
to achieve a certain level of prominence in their careers or in the eyes of the world, New York is the place to do it. 
(Are you humming, â€œIf I can make it there, I'll make it anywhere," right now?)</p>

<p>There's a factual basis to this New Yorker's pride. Because of the density and diversity of our population; our long 
history as a center of commerce and ideas; our access to the United Nations, Wall Street, and the opinion makers of 
Madison Avenue; and endless other resources, there's simply more here than in other places. And if that claim seems 
extreme, well, you'll just have to regard boastfulness as another unavoidable characteristic of "the Big Apple." 
What would New Yorkers be without our big mouths? </p>

<p>In visiting New York, you, too, are opening yourself up to a world of wonderful opportunities. In fact, that's what 
can make New York so intimidating to visitors: There are just so many darn choices. But we've sorted through a myriad 
of options, selecting some favorites to help you hit the city's highlights. These NYC Landmarks, sorted by borough, will
surely make for a wonderful visit and help anyone get a true taste of NYC.</p>
